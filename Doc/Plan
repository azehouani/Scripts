	•	Install Ansible, Python, JFrog
	•	Retrieve artifacts from JFrog using the branch name
	•	Create the inventory file and verify the connection between GitHub and different environments
	•	Create an Ansible playbook that allows:

	•	extracting the ZIP file and deploying it to the target environment using the project name
	•	replacing log4j for each project if the library is included
	•	starting the necessary services
